# docker-node-php-stack
Sample Docker stack made with Docker Compose running mostly Alpine-based images (for smaller size) with Node.js (for serving some JS app in the frontend) and Nginx with PHP7 (used as an API backend for the frontend). HAproxy is used as a proxy for the node & nginx web server.

This example may need some configuration changes in order to get to work, it just serves as a starting point.
